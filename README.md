## ✨ Project Description

The Flying Ball Game is an arcade-style **endless runner** developed to challenge player reflexes and timing. Built using **[., Python and Pygame]**, the player controls a ball that must navigate through a series of randomly generated obstacles, relying on physics and momentum to survive.

### Why this project?
This project serves as a foundation for a future deep reinforcement learning environment, designed to train an autonomous agent to master complex, continuous-action gameplay.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
You need **[REQUIRED SOFTWARE, e.g., Python 3.9+]** installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # If using Pygame:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, list the dependencies here, e.g., `pip install pygame`)*

3.  **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    # Command to start the main game file
    python [YOUR_MAIN_FILE_NAME].py
    ```

## 🎮 Game Controls

| Action | Key / Input |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Jump/Thrust** | Spacebar or Left Mouse Click |
| **Pause** | P |
| **Exit** | Esc |

## 🧠 AI / MLOps Focus

This environment is structured to support future AI integration:

* **Observation Space:** Configured to easily capture state information (ball position, obstacle distance, velocity).
* **Reward Function:** Simple, continuous reward based on survival time and distance traveled.
* **Planned Agent:** Integration with **Stable Baselines3** or **Ray R-Liib** to train a PPO or DQN agent to achieve optimal scores.
